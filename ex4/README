our "phone number" is 06664120

system designe didn't change. you can read ex3's README for our elaboration about it.

we will focuse on the FS design and on the optimization design.

FILE SYSTEM DESIGN
------------------
 * we implemented a version of the article http://static.usenix.org/event/usenix05/tech/general/full_papers/gal/gal_html/.

 * every 4Kb is called EraseUnit since this is the smallest unit the flash can erase
 
 * our 64Kb flash composed of 16 EraseUnits (blocks), our FS uses 15 EraseUnits to store files and one EraseUnit (a.k.a the Log) for compaction process (we will elaborate about that)
 
 * when file need to be written, we appilys First Fit Algoritm and place it at the first free slot we find.
 
 * when not enough free space been found, we try to compact some EraseUnit. we check if EraseUnit's free space + EraseUnit obsolete space (=space of deleted files) will be enough 
   to host the new file, if yes, we moving the valid files of the EraseUnit to the log, erasing the EraseUnit and converting it to the new log, the previouse log will become regular EraseUnit 
   and will host the new file
   
 * to achive atomicity, we took advanage of the fact that we using NOR flash in which bits been turn off. every such operation has "valid" bit, we performing the operation which leaving this valid bit
   as "1" and only then we changing this bit only to "0". this chnage is atomic since we turning off one bit only and this valid bit indicates that whole section is valid.
   
 * we developed fail safe mechanism to ensure that every operation either will succeed or fail without corrupting the FS no matter what happened (as long as no one from the outside chnage the flash bits)
   1. write file - every file has "valid" bit, if this bit wasen't set at the end of the write, we ignore the file (file will be considered as deleted)
   2. delete file - we implemented the delete operation as turning the "obsolete" bit of the file from 1 to 0, thus, this operation is atomic
   3. EraseUnit compaction - we saved the last 4 bytes of the Log to save some essential info about the compaction. when we loading the FS during boot, we check those 4 bytes, and if the "complete" bit is
      not '0' we continue from the point we failed last time (we know when we failed by some controll bits inside those 4 bytes)
	  
 * corruption from the outside - every EraseUnit has some special value (canary) after its header. when loading the FS during boot, we check those canaries, and if more than one is missing (one can be missing if
   during the block erase we crashed, if one canary is missing, we check that the EraseUnit is indeed the erase unit we wrote at the log's last 4 bytes) if so, we have a reson to belive our FS is corrupted by some
   attacker or by malfunction and we re-install the FS structure and getting new and empty FS.
   
 * BONUS PART!!!
 
	we implemented ware out mechanism. every EraseUnit has "Erase Number" which is the number of erasure this EraseUnit had. when we searching for block to erase (because we want to write file and don't have
	enough free space) we search for the EraseUnit with lowest Erase Number value which has enough space. this way will lead to uniform distribution of EraseUnits' erasures if we assume that when deleting a file every
	file has the same probability to be deleted.
				
	we stessed the FS with maximum file's size fs_write("file",buf,512) with the same file name - every write will delete the previosue file "file". we did it few thousends of times and monitored the Erase Number distribution.
	we found that it was Uniform Distribution all along.


OPTIMIZATIONS
-------------
* Minimize used FLASH size - we were able to use 64KB flash size to support up to 105 files of 0.5Kb or up to 4710 files of 0Kb. read the FILE SYSTEM DESIGN section for detailed explanation

* Minimize used ROM size - we squieez all our code into 64KB ROM...

* Minimize used RAM size - we went all over golbal data structures and make sure we don't use more than we need.
						   we used minimum stack size of 1024bytes per thread, we made sure this is more than enough by placing canaries (spaceal values like 0xDEADBEEF or 0xABABABAB) at the end
						   of the stack, stress the system and make sure that this value didn't overrune.
						   
						   we paied some RAM space to store data structure for the FileSystem. this DATS save us many many FLASH access and we think this is a good trade off since FLASH IO is relatively 
						   slow and expensive.
							

* Minimize power consumption - 	all threads waiting on events flag for an event such as packet arrives or user press a button which been set by the ISRs. no busy waiting at all!
								we made the processor halt when system is idle. we did it by running thread with the lowest priority. this thread will run ONLY when all other threads
								idle, this way the system will halt when there is no activity.
