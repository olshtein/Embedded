============================remarks====================================
* All the drivers we wrote in this exercise is polling-based, and we not used 
interrupts, as required.
* The cyclicBuffer used us in the implementation of the required asynchronous 
protocol. It used us to store information (bytes) that came from the serial port,
until it will have enough bytes to generate a full command (1 byte for the 
command, 1 byte for the variable, and 2 bytes for the values).
* We thought to put the cyclicBuffer into the Uart driver, but we decided that 
we want to simplifies much as possible the Uart. So the Uart reads and writes 
only one byte a time.
